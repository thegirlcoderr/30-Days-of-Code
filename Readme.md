# 30-Days-of-Code
 
In this challenge, I will be submitting little to medium size projects. I'm doing this to boost my HTML, CSS & JS skills and also cultivate the habit of daily coding. Each day has a Readme file that contains a breakdown of the task and progress for the day. 

Here is a couple of live previews of projects I'm working on.
